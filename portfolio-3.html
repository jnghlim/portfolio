        <h3> Purpose of this Project </h3>
        
        <p>
            These days, it is obvious to see extreme weather change. Many natural disasters have been occurring throughout 
            the whole world. Even though we could easily encounter these disastrous news through a lot of media, it seems that 
            many people do not recognize the seriousness of the situation. For example, drought have been an issue in United States 
            for a long time, but people's lifestyle have not changed. They still use a lot of water and while they are using it, they 
            do not consider how urgent the situation is.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            I thought people do not consider and take it lightly because they just heard about it from someone else. I believed that if 
            they see something visual that shows how the earth's environment is going on right now since past few years, they might have 
            taken it heavier and recognized the situation properly. Therefore, I decided to web-scrape from official government precipitation 
            website and visually help them to understand the situation easily.
        </p>

        <h3> Web Scraping </h3>

        <p>
            By using 'beautifulsoup4' library, scrapper scrapped all the rows of the table from https://www.cnrfc.noaa.gov/ and saved it 
            to csv file using 'csv' library. Each row consists of the ID(ID of location), location name and precipitations for each month. 
            While scrapping, I decided to exclude rows which had 'M' in index because all the rows that had 'M' in the index had missing 
            value for 'Total WY' and 'Pct Avg to Date'. 'Total WY' column and having missing data points were crucial to analyze the data.
        </p>

        <h3> Data Visualization </h3>

        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-3-img/all_precip.png" alt="total precip">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> From the bar graph above, the amount of crime had been constantly decreasing since <strong>2011</strong>.
            Probably because of the development of technology and science. The more developed technology, the more probability that police 
            can catch crimes and easier to prevent the crimes with Cameras for example.
        </p>
        
        <h4> Law Category </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/arrest date categories.jpg" alt="law categories">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> When we looked at the "Folium" map, there were only blue and orange circles and this graph supports
            the visualization. In the graph, the number of felony and misdemeanor are significantly higher than the other type of crimes.
            Interesting part is that there is really small amount of crime occurrences of violation and infraction while the number of 
            felony crimes is pretty much consistent. The crime of misdemeanor has still the highest, but it had been consistently
            decreasing.
        </p>

        <h4> Race / Gender </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/gender_ethnicity.jpg" alt="g_e">
        </div>
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> The graph also illustrated the difference of the crime rate between the races and genders.
            Black people tend to commit more crimes than that of other races, and men tend to commit more crimes than that of female.
        </p>
        
        <h4> Age </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/age.jpg" alt="age">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Most of the observaction can be seen as obvious, but there is also an interesting observation. There are few people who are older
            than 65 still committing crimes. It is still quite small amount of numbers compared to other age groups, but still it was an 
            interesting data for me to observe. 
        </p>


        <p>
            After looking at the crime rates visualization for each categorical feature, I visualized the crime rate for each community district
            which are Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Bronx. After that, I counted the number of crime occurrences for each
            section code within the community district and listed which place is safe to visit and which place is not safe to visit and made
            a <strong>Tour Visit Guide.</strong>
