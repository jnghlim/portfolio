        <p>
            Observing how the amount of customer purchases and spends differs by the campaign which each customer accepts. Therefore,
            we can decide which campaign was more effective and which campaign fits the best for certain groups.

        <h4>2. Overall Sales and Ratings (+Interactivity)</h4>
        <img src="tableau1-img/overall.png" alt="overall">
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    From the graph (top left corner), the trend line (pink dotted line) indicates that the sales amount 
                    has been constantly decreasing over the last three months.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    Clicking on each branch, we can notice that...
                    <ul>
                        <li>Branch C has the highest Total sales & Ratings.</li>
                        <li>Branch B has the lowest Ratings.</li>
                        <li>Branch A and B have the lowest Total sales</li>
                        <li>The amount of sales was the highest at 19:00 for all of the branches.</li>
                        <li>Rest of the time period, the amount of sales varied among the branches.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4><i>Questions</i></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Which Product line/Gender should we aim for each branch to increase the Sales?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Why do A and B Branch have lower Ratings/Sales compared to C branch?</li>
                <li>Why does C Branch have higher Ratings/Sales compared to other branches?</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        
        <h4>3. Relationship between the Unit Price of the Products and Sales</h4>
        <img src="tableau1-img/unit_prices.png" alt="unitprice">
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    From the graph at the top, we can notice each branch's average price for each product line.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    From the graph at right-bottom, we can notice the number of quantities that were sold by product lines & branhces.
                    If the product line that is placed at a high rank within this graph also has high average unit price, the profit maximizes.
                    The more you sell expensive products, the more you get profits out of it.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    Clicking on each branch, we can notice that...
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For branch C, Top 2 Product lines for selling the most amount of quantities matches with
                            the Top 2 Product lines for average unit prices. The graph from left bottom also indicates that Top 2 Product lines for
                            those branches have the most amount of profits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Branch B have also matching product lines, but branch A does not. The reasons why both branches have lower total
                            sales than that of branch C are..
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    For branch A, Top 2 Product lines for selling the most amount of quantities do not match with the Top 2 product lines
                                    for average unit prices. Also the average unit price for Health and Beauty is way much lower than that of
                                    other branches.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    For branch B, even though it has matching product lines, total quantities are the lowest among the branches
                                    and the average unit price for Electronics Accessories is way much lower than that of other branches and this
                                    product line's rank for the "amount of quantities sold" is 3 which is pretty high
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    <p></p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>From this slide, we were able to see that selling expensive products matters to the branch's total sales.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4> 4. Top N Customers for each Branch </h4>
        <img src="tableau1-img/top_customers.png" alt="top_customers">
        <ul>
            <li>
                This dashboard indicates Top N number of customers who purchased the product most with the details of which product line they
                purchased, which supports the previous conclusion.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can interactively maniuplate the number of Top customers at the top.

                Right graph shows how rating differs by Gender, Payment method and Customer types. This graph indicates which group we
                should target the most to increase the ratings.
            </li>
            <li>
                By clicking on each branches...
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Branch A and B have ratings around 7 among all the product lines
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Branch B have two product lines with ratings around 6.5 which are "Home and Lifestyle" and "Sports and Travel".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By clicking on each product lines and taking a look at average unit prices...
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The product lines with low ratings have high average unit prices while there was other product line
                                which had higher average unit price with high ratings. I consider this happened because two product lines
                                which give us low ratings have higher unit prices than they supposed to be.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Those two product lines at branch C, which had the most total sales have pretty low average unit prices compared
                                to branch B.
                            </li>
