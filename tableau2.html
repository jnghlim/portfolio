        <p>
            Observing how the amount of customer purchases and spends money differs by the campaign which each customer accepts. Therefore,
            we can decide which campaign was more effective and which campaign fits the best for certain groups.

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                   By looking at this dashboard, we can see that the amount of customer purchases and spend money for Treatment
                   campaign is higher than that of the Control Campaign. This applies to every category of the products(Fish, Fruits, 
                   Gold, Meat, Sweet, Wines), and every way how customer purchases the products(Catalog, Store, Web).
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    However, the insights we can get from visualziation differs by the income group. Divided income group approximately
                    which was referred by the website "World Bank Blogs" - New World Bank country classifications by income level: 2021-2022
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Differs by Income Group</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Low Income</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <img src="tableau2-img/low income.png" alt="income1">
                    <p>
                        Among the Low income group, people who are exposed to <strong>Treatment Campaign</strong> tend to purchase and spend money more than
                        that of people who are exposed to <strong>Control Campaign</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Low income group, Treatment Campaign performed better.
                    </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <li>Middle Income</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <img src="tableau2-img/Mid Income.png" alt="income2">
                    <p>
                        Middle income group has an even distribution between the two Campaigns and has some categories that 
                        <strong>Control Campaign</strong> has higher amount. (Total amount of Purchases, Wines - Product Category,
                         Store - Purchase Method)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Middle income group, <strong>Control Campaign</strong> also has significant amount of purchases and money spent by customers,
                        compared to other income groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was only a slight difference where the categories that <strong>Control Campaign</strong> affected more than that
                        of <strong>Treatment Campaign</strong>. It is hard to conclude that one specific Campaign affected Middle income group
                        the most overall.
                    </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <li>High Income</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <img src="tableau2-img/High Income.png" alt="income3">
                    <p>
                        High income group has simple and interesting insights. There was no one who purchased or spent money that are exposed
                        from <strong>Control Campaign</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Probably because there was not enough data points of people who are in High income range. The amount of purchases
                        and money spent by customers differ a lot from other income groups.
                    </p>

                        For this condition, it was interesting to see how the amount of influence that <strong>Control Campaign</strong>
                        affects to the customer consistently decrease as the frequency of website visit increases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another interesting insight is that significant amount of money customer spent for <strong>Control Campaign</strong>
                        decreased for all of the product categories except for the "Wine" cateogry until the frequency of website visit reached 9.

                        This dashboard gives us an interesting insights. There is only one single age group(50s) who are more affected by the
                        <strong>Control Treatment</strong>. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Age group of 70s have slightly more affected by the <strong>Control Campaign</strong> for total money spent from Customers, and
                        slightly more affected by the <strong>Treatment Campaign</strong> for Total Purchases
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        This dashboard also gives us an interesting insights like above. All the groups of people who are single(Absurd, Alone, Divorced, Widow, YOLO)
                        were affected mostly by the <strong>Treatment Campaign</strong> while the married group is more affected by the control group.

                    <li>
                        It indicates that <strong>Treatment Campaign</strong> fits better for the single group and <strong>Control Campaign</strong>
                        fits better for the couple group.
                    </li>
