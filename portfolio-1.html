        <h3> Data Explorartion / EDA </h3>
        
        <p>
            I have used the data from website Kaggle to predict the Heart Attack rate of the patient based on their biological dataset
            such as their age, gender, cholesterol amount etc.  Below is the head of the data that I used.
        </p>
        <img src="portfolio-1-img/dataset.png" alt="data">

        <p>
            After checking up with the data, see if there is any null values and see how many unique values for each columns, I have changed
            the categorical values into numeric values using mapping function to visualize those into plots. Below image shows the distribution
            of each categorical features.
        </p>
        <img src="portfolio-1-img/Categorical Features.jpg" alt="categorical features">
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> From the graphs above, I was able to find out that all the features contribute to heart attack at least in certain level
        </p>

        <p>
            Among all the categorical features, I have decided to get statistics of "gender" feature it is easy to comprehend for people who sees
            this project and this is the feature which people mostly want from the data.
        </p>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/Gender Heart Attack Rate.png" alt="gender stats">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> From the statistic of "gender" feature above, it was clear to see that male has higher possibility
            of having a heart attack than that of female.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the visualization of the categorical features, I have decided to look into the numeric categorical features such as
            age, chol, and etc. Below graphs represent the distribution of each numeric features.
        </p>
        <img src="portfolio-1-img/Continuous Features KDE Plots.jpg" alt="KDE">
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> KDE Plot represents the data using a continuous probability density curve. The more two kde plots overlap, the less difference between
        those two. As I mentioned it before, from the KDE plots I was able to see that every features have certain effect on heart attack rate.
        Among all the features, I was able to find out that "cholesterol rate" feature has the least amount of impact on heart attack.
        </p>

        <p>
            If there is a significant difference between two features, it is better to illustrate the difference with the graphs.
            However, if there two features on the graph is simillar, I thought it would be better to show the heatmap to illustrate the
            detailed difference between them. Below shows the heatmap(Correlation) of the continuous features.
        </p>
        <img src="portfolio-1-img/Continuous Features Heatmap.png" alt="Heatmap">
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> From the Heatmap I was able to figure out that "age" and "thalachh" features have the highest
            correlation and "trtbps" and "thalachh" have the least. The annotation of the Heatmap shows that "age" and "thalachh" features
            are correlated with the value of -0.4, which means that whenever age increases, thalachh decreases and vice versa.
        </p>

        <p>Among all the continuous features, I have decided to pick one feature which was "age" to plot a histogram to see the distribution.
            Below illustrates the histogram and statistic of "age" feature.
        </p>
        <img src="portfolio-1-img/Age Visualization.png" alt="Age Histogram">
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/Age Heart Attack Rate 1.png" alt="Age Stats" class="port1img_marg">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/Age Heart Attack Rate 2.png" alt="Age Stats" class="port1img_marg">
        </div>
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i>
            I have excluded the <strong>20s'</strong> heart attack rate because there was not enough data. The amount of data is unbalanced
            between the <strong>(30s-60s)</strong> and <strong>(30s and 70s)</strong>. Just by looking at the numbers of "more chance of heart 
            attack", <strong>50s</strong> have the highest, but they have the highest number of "less chance of heart attack" at the same time. 
            With the statistic, I was able to conclude that the most vulnerable age range was surprisingly <strong>40s</strong>. 
        </p>

        <h3> Prediction </h3> 
        
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/Scatter plot of two important features.jpg" alt="scatter">
        </div>
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Above picture is a scatter plot of the two most important features (Highly contributes to predict the output) 
            of this data which are "thalachh", and "oldpeak". As you can see that data is hard to be separated linearly. Therefore, I assume 
            the models that use linear method won't perform well.
        </p>

        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/Model Accuracy Scores.png" alt="scores">
        </div>
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Above Dataframe illustrates the each model's accuracy scores and like I have assumed before, the methods
            that use linear method did not perform well, but KNN model performed the best instead.
        </p>

        <h4> ROC Curve of the Best Model (KNN) </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/ROC Curve of KNN model.jpg" alt="ROC">
        </div>
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> 
            The ROC Curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. If the model gives the curves closer to the top-left
            corner, it indicates a better performance. On the other hand, if the model gives the curves closer to the 45 degree diagonal line,
            it represents the less accuracy.
        </p>

        <h4>KNN Visualization</h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/KNN Visualization.jpg" alt="KNN Vis">
        </div>
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i>
            In order to visualize the KNN classification, I had to choose two features that are correlated the least and which both correlates
            the most to the output which are "cp", "oldpeak". (Referred to the heatmap below.)As a result, KNN Classification with only two 
            features gave us 80% of accuracy which is pretty good.
        </p>
