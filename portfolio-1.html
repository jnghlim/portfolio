        <h3> Data Explorartion / EDA </h3>
        
        <p>
            I have used the data from website Kaggle to visualize the Studnets' exam (reading, writing, math) score based on the data of 
            each student's status such as "Did he/she have lunch before the test?", "Parent's education level", "Has he/she completed test
             preparation course?", and "Race/Ethnicity". The main point of this project was to see the relationship between the features above
             and the test scores.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Graph above shows the distribution of the student for each feature. Y axis of each graph represents 
            the number of students. For the gender feature, I was able to see that data is well balanced. There are various kinds for
            parental level of education and race features. We now need to see the comparison of the mean scores for each feature. The graph
            for each feature

        <h4> Arrested Date </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/arrest date.jpg" alt="date">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> From the bar graph above, the amount of crime had been constantly decreasing since <strong>2011</strong>.
            Probably because of the development of technology and science. The more developed technology, the more probability that police 
            can catch crimes and easier to prevent the crimes with Cameras for example.
        </p>
        
        <h4> Law Category </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/arrest date categories.jpg" alt="law categories">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> When we looked at the "Folium" map, there were only blue and orange circles and this graph supports
            the visualization. In the graph, the number of felony and misdemeanor are significantly higher than the other type of crimes.
            Interesting part is that there is really small amount of crime occurrences of violation and infraction while the number of 
            felony crimes is pretty much consistent. The crime of misdemeanor has still the highest, but it had been consistently
            decreasing.
        </p>

        <h4> Race / Gender </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/gender_ethnicity.jpg" alt="g_e">
        </div>
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> The graph also illustrated the difference of the crime rate between the races and genders.
            Black people tend to commit more crimes than that of other races, and men tend to commit more crimes than that of female.
        </p>
        
        <h4> Age </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/age.jpg" alt="age">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Most of the observaction can be seen as obvious, but there is also an interesting observation. There are few people who are older
            than 65 still committing crimes. It is still quite small amount of numbers compared to other age groups, but still it was an 
            interesting data for me to observe. 
        </p>


        <p>
            After looking at the crime rates visualization for each categorical feature, I visualized the crime rate for each community district
            which are Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Bronx. After that, I counted the number of crime occurrences for each
            section code within the community district and listed which place is safe to visit and which place is not safe to visit and made
            a <strong>Tour Visit Guide.</strong>
