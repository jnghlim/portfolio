        <h3> Data Explorartion / EDA </h3>
        
        <p>
            I have used the data from website Kaggle to predict the Subscription rate. Re-organized and modified the data and 
            visualized them to illustrate the distribution of customers' financial status. 
        </p>

        <h4>Data Distribution</h4>
        <img src="portfolio-5-img/Data_Distribution.jpeg" alt="dist">
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Y-axis from the graphs represent the count of the data for each column.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We are able to see that there are...
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    More people who do not have loan
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    More people who are married
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    More people who completed secondary education.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    More people who use cellular device for their contact
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    More people who have own housing
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Most people who joined bank in January.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Job Distribution</h4>
        <img src="portfolio-5-img/Subscription_Rate_by_Job.jpg" alt="subscription">
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    From the graph above, the outcome of no-subscription is way much higher than the subscription. Among all the jobs,
                    the lowest category was student and the highest category was blue-collar. However, people who describe themselves as
                    management had the highest subscription rate.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Linearity of the Data</h4>
        <img src="portfolio-5-img/Linearity_of_Data.jpg" alt="KDE">
        <ul>
            <li>
                The graph above represents the linearity of the data (X-axis:Duration, Y-axis:Balance). Since it does not have a linearity, 
                I assume the model with Logistic Regression, and SVC that utilizes the linearity of the data would not perform well compared
                to other models.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Encoding Plan</h4>
        <img src="portfolio-5-img/encoding_plan.png" alt="KDE">
        <ul>
            <li>
             I decided to plan encoding like above. Encoded month column into sin/cosine encoding since for month, higher value does not represent 
            'better' compared to lower value (December is not better than January).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <img src="portfolio-5-img/accuracy_table.jpeg" alt="KDE">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Created a model with "Logistic Regression", "Gaussian NB", "KNN", "Decision Tree", "Random Forest", "SVC", and "XGB Classifier"
                and compared the performance.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Feature Importance</h4>
        <img src="portfolio-5-img/Feature_importance.jpeg" alt="Heatmap">
        <ul>
            <li>
                From the graph above, colums "poutcome success" and "duration" had the most postivie effect on the prediction and "poutcome unkown"
                and "contact unknown" had the most negative effect on the prediction.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Best Performed Model Evaluation</h4>
        <h5>Log_Loss</h5>
        <img src="portfolio-5-img/Log_Loss.jpeg" alt="Age Histogram">
        <h5>Classifictaion Error</h5>
        <img src="portfolio-5-img/Classification_error.jpeg" alt="Age Histogram">

        <ul>
            <li>
                We are able to see the Log Loss of the XGB Classifier model decreases significantly approximately at 10th epoch, and it remains
                until the end of the epochs. Therefore, we could have done only 15-18 epochs to reduce the amount of time for modeling since the
                amount of log loss remains the same after the 20th epochs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Similarly, the classification error rate is dropped the most approximately at 15th epochs and it remains almost the same even though
                it fluctuates a little bit.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>ROC Curve</h5>
        <img src="portfolio-5-img/ROC_Curve_KNN.jpeg" alt="Age Histogram">
        <ul>
            <li>
                The ROC Curve above represents the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity and classifier that gives curve closer to 
                the top-left corner indicates a better performance. As a baseline, a random classifier is expected to give points lying along the diagonal.
                The closer the curve comes to the 45-degree diagonal of the ROC space, the less accurate the test.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    From three graphs above, we are able to see that this model fits well since it neither overfits nor underfits the data.
                </strong>
            </li>
