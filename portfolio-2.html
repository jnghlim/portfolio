        <h3> Data Explorartion / EDA </h3>
        
        <p>
            I have used the data from website Kaggle to visualize the Crime rate in New York City based on the data of each occurrence of
            the crime. After checking up with the data, I cleansed my unorganized data (categorical values with unreadable letters, abbreviations), 
            using pandas library (used mapping and renaming). 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            After data cleansing, I used <strong>"Folium"</strong> library from python to visualize the data points, dividing up the colors for each community 
            districts (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island). 
        </p>
        
        <ul>Navy Circle: Misdemeanor</ul>
        <ul>Orange Circle: Felony</ul>
        <ul>Green Circle: Violation</ul>
        <ul>Red Circle: Infraction</ul>

        <img src="portfolio-2-img/map.png" alt="map">
        <p>Below button is connected to a page where you can zoom in and out or move around the map.</p>
        <p><a href="map.html" class="footer__link">Folium Map</a></p>

        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> From the Folium map, the colors are mostly navys and oranges which are misdemeanor and felony.
            If you go into the link and zoom in few red and green circles are noticed also, but there are not as many as the navy and
            orange circles.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, I visualized the data by "Date", "Law Category", "Race/Gender", and "Age"
        </p>

        <h4> Arrested Date </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/arrest date.jpg" alt="date">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> From the bar graph above, the amount of crime had been constantly decreasing since <strong>2011</strong>.
            Probably because of the development of technology and science. The more developed technology, the more probability that police 
            can catch crimes and easier to prevent the crimes with Cameras for example.
        </p>
        
        <h4> Law Category </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/arrest date categories.jpg" alt="law categories">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> When we looked at the "Folium" map, there were only blue and orange circles and this graph supports
            the visualization. In the graph, the number of felony and misdemeanor are significantly higher than the other type of crimes.
            Interesting part is that there is really small amount of crime occurrences of violation and infraction while the number of 
            felony crimes is pretty much consistent. The crime of misdemeanor has still the highest, but it had been consistently
            decreasing.
        </p>

        <h4> Race / Gender </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/gender_ethnicity.jpg" alt="g_e">
        </div>
        <p><i class="fas fa-book"></i> The graph also illustrated the difference of the crime rate between the races and genders.
        </p>
        
        <h4> Age </h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-2-img/age.jpg" alt="age">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Most of the observaction can be seen as obvious, but there is also an interesting observation. There are few people who are older
            than 65 still committing crimes. It is still quite small amount of numbers compared to other age groups, but still it was an 
            interesting data to observe. 
        </p>


        <p>
            After looking at the crime rates visualization for each categorical feature, I visualized the crime rate for each community district
            which are Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Bronx. After that, I counted the number of crime occurrences for each
            section code within the community district and listed which place is safe to visit and which place is not safe to visit and made
            a <strong>Tour Visit Guide.</strong>
