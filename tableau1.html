        <h5>1. Aims Grid</h5>

        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Graph above shows the distribution of the student for each feature. Y axis of each graph represents 
            the number of students. For the gender feature, I was able to see that data is well balanced. There are various kinds for
            parental level of education and race features. 
        </p>

        <img src="portfolio-1-img/score_dist.png" alt="scores_map">
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Graph above shows the distribution of the student's score for each test. From the graph above, it is
            hard to tell which subject has higher average test score because their distributions look similar.Therefore, I decided to visualize
            the mean score for each subject.
        </p>
        
        <h4> Mean Scores Comparison</h4>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/scores_box_plot.jpeg" alt="scores_box_map">
        </div>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/mean_score_plot.jpeg" alt="scores_map">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Like I mentioned above, even though the amount of distance from the farthest outliers to the third
            quantiles is slightly different for each subject, there was no significant difference of the mean scores between the subjects.
            We now need to see the comparison of the mean scores for each feature. The graph for each feature divided into each subject.
        </p>

        <h4> Scores Comparions - For each Features </h4>

        <h5> Gender </h5>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/gender.png" alt="Gender">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> This distribution gives us an interesting outcome. There are more male workers who are in STEM industry
            than that of females and this distribution proves it. The mean score of the math test is higher for male students while for 
            other tests, females has higher mean scores (writing and reading). 
        </p>
        
        <h5> Race/Ethnicity </h5>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/group.png" alt="race">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> I wasn't able to find out which alphabet represents which race/ethnicity. But I was able to conclude
            that the mean score of the test was affected by the race and ethnicity. The graph was plotted in order from lowest to highest,
            illustrating from left to right. The order of the group for each subject was consistent.
        </p>

        <h5> Lunch </h5>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/lunch.png" alt="lunch">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> When I used to take SAT test, I did not eat anything because I got too nervous on every single test 
            and that disturbed me. However, this graph tells me that I would have gotten better score if I had a meal before the test. 
            Those graphs clearly shows that the mean score of the students who had lunch was higher than that of students who did not have
            lunch.
        </p>
        
        <h5> Parental Level of Education </h5>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/parental_level.png" alt="lunch">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Graph above also shows that the parental level of education also matters their students' test scores
            because the mean score of each subject was consistent for each parental level of education.
        </p>


        <h5> Test Preparation </h5>
        <div class="port1img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/test_preparation.png" alt="lunch">
        </div>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Studying with diligent attitude with consistency is important. However, this graph shows that 
            the test preparation course is also important. The mean score of each subject for students who have completed their test 
            preparation was higher than that of students who have not completed their test preparation.
        </p>

        <h4> Correlations between the Subjects </h4>
        <p>
            After comparing the mean score of each features, I decided to see the relationship between the test scores for each subject.
        </p>

        <div class="port2img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/correlation_scatter.png" alt="scatter">
        </div>
        <div class="port2img">
            <img src="portfolio-1-img/correlation_heat.png" alt="heatmap">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            The graphs above tells you that the person who got a good score on certain subject will get a good score on other tests.
            It was interesting because there are certain people who are good at certain subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heatmap supports this statement. Except for the boxes that are located on diagnoal line, all of the boxes have around
            0.8 correlation among the subjects.
        </p>
